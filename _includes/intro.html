	<h1> Hello! </h1>
	<p><strong> My name is Tanim Mahmud</strong> </p>
	<p>I’m a web app developer experienced with HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I've always been interested in programming and web development. While my background is in Civil Engineering, I am looking to make a career change into web development, which is where my passion lies. I really enjoy building new things using different technologies.</p>
	<p> I have displayed my pair programming skills while doing few group projects in Coder Factory. I have developed research, leadership, management, analysis, problem-solving and critical thinking skills from my engineering background and thus I am prepared to take on significant responsibility early in my professional career. I’m really passionate about the work I do and would love if there were opportunities for me to grow with the company. </p>
	<p>I am also a father of a beautiful girl named Isabela. My favourite past time is to play with her while I am at home.</p>
