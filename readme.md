# Portfolio Site of Tanim Mahmud

# Design Documentation

## Site's audience.

  My targeted visitors will be my prospective employers and fellow developers.

## Design decisions

  The website has 5 pages - home, resume, portfolio, blog and contact page. Home page has all basic information about me and all links to find my details . For busy employers home page will be enough to learn about me. I created other pages to show more details about my projects and resume. I also made a contact page to make it easy to contact me. In my resume page I also have download resume option so that prospective employers can download my resume for internal use.
  Navigation tabs are available in the footer so that visitors can easily navigate through the pages. I made all the links available using keyboard for make it more accessible. I chose black and white theme to fit with my personality. I used color combinations considering color blind people.  

## Usability heuristics

  * I only provided relevant informations.
  * Informed visitors which page they are visiting by highlighting navigation menu.
  * I was very careful about my writing to make it understandable for all visitors.
  * All of the pages followed same design and color combinations. Navigations are in the same place. Headers are always in same fonts and text are same fronts and size.
  * I made navigations and social links in the footer so that visitors do not have to scroll page to find useful informations.
  * I used comparatively bigger font size and design to make it more usable and less stress for low vision people.

#### Spacing and Sizes

The logo should always be surrounded by a minimum area of space. The area of isolation ensures that headlines, text or other visual elements do not encroach on the logo.

There are no predetermined sizes for the  logo. Scale and proportion should be determined by the available space, aesthetics, function and visibility.

There is no preset maximum size for the  logo. However, minimum sizes font size of the logo is 24 px with 10 px padding.

### Typography

Exo should be used for all header and sub header text, where Open Sans should be used for all other copy (body, quotes etc). To ensure a consistent look, make sure fonts are used in a consistent manner and the weights of the font have been considered, using heavier weights for headers and the highlight key messages.
